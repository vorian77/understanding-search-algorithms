# Understanding Search Algorithms
**Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to help students and other programmers gain a better understanding of search algorithms.

It provides a sandbox of four search algorithm implementations written in Python, three graphs of different complexities, and a test suite of configurable experiments that show how the different algorithms perform on the same search challenges.

The code for the algorithms is derived from a common class that demonstrates the fundamental structure of search, with documentation that highlights the common and unique components of each algorithm.

The algorithms implemented are:
* A-Star Search
* Uniform Cost Search
* Breath First Search
* Depth First Search

**Background**

I'm enrolled in the Udacity.com Intro to Self-Driving Cars Nano Degree program. I completed the Route Planner project, which demonstrates how web mapping apps like Google Maps provide the shortest possible route between different locations. Here is my implementation: https://github.com/vorian77/Udacity-ISDC-Route-Planner

After completing the project, I still didn't completely understand A-Star search, which the project was based on. I decided to play around with the project code by adding different search algorithms.

In the end, I got a great understanding of the mechanics of the search algorithms by comparing and contrasting the code with the results of the experiments, which show their operational and performance characteristics.

Another cool outcome was learning the history of these particular algorithms and how science advances the state of the art. They were published in a span from the 1800s to 1968. Each was advanced by computer scientists and mathematicians who were making improvements on the past versions to better solve a contemporary challenge.
